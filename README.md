# Deep-Learning-Image-Classification

### 1. The Problem: Image Classification

In regular programming, you write rules and conditions in your code so the program knows what to do. This works great for many different problems.

But when it comes to image classification, getting a program to recognize and sort images it has never seen before.. in traditional programming is near impossible to solve it. How could a human could possibly write enough rules to correctly classify tons of different images?

### 2. The Solution: Deep Learning
Deep learning is great at recognizing patterns through trial and error. By training a deep neural network with sufficient data, and providing feedback on its performance via training, the network can identify, though a huge iteration, its own set of conditions by which it can act in the correct way.
